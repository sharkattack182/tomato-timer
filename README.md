# Tomato Timer

## Purpose
As I continue my coding journey I have ecided to go back over all of my original bootcamp course work to keep improving my skills. The idea being I can work through the problems I originally ran into during the bootcamp while working to dry up code in projects and compare the codes to measure progress. While I dont create repositories for each exercise in the bootcamp, I have decided to do so for each of the closing chapter exercises. These are normally all encompassing projects that incorporate all the lessons learned in a chapter. During the course we were only given an hour to work on this. I remember feeling very discouraged after this particular assignment. I really didnt get very far. I kept my head up and trusted the process and now I completed the assigment in a little under an hour with no direct guidence which is very encouraging.

## Process 
This app is a simple timer that allows a user to set a two timers, one for working, one for resting. The timer has the ability to pause and resume the time as well as stopping and resetting the timer. This was a chapter ending exercise and it encoperated all the tools we learned. Basic javascript skills include the building of the interval as well as using DOM manipulation to render the time. There were multiple if statements used mainly in the logic for determining if the timer was being used to for work or rest. At the end as a bonus I set timer preferences to local storage and called them the next time the user opens the app.
