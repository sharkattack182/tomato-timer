# Tomato Timer

## Execution 
This app is a simple timer that allows a user to set a two timers, one for working, one for resting. The timer has the ability to pause and resume the time as well as stopping and resetting the timer. This was a chapter ending exercise and it encoperated all the tools we learned. Basic javascript skills include the building of the interval as well as using DOM manipulation to render the time. There were multiple if statements used mainly in the logic for determining if the timer was being used to for work or rest. At the end as a bonus I set timer preferences to local storage and called them the next time the user opens the app.
